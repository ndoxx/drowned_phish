# drowned_phish
A small tool I made to flood phishers' databases with fake but credible information.

Fake credentials are generated from several lists of names, pseudonyms and addresses. I use crazyjunkie's generator to create valid credit card numbers that pass the MOD 10 check. This tool is programmed to generate plausible __FRENCH__ credentials, but it should be easy enough to adapt for any other country. drowned_phish comes with two actual scammer profiles I used during development. The codebase is not that great at the moment, because well... I'm no Python expert.
